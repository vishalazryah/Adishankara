                Civil engineering is one of the world's great professions. It is the the oldest engineering discipline. Civil engineers are responsible for virtually all the great structures around us today. Civil Engineering possess huge scope and contains wide spectrum of sub-discplines including architectural engineering, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering,  structural engineering, earthquake engineering, transportation engineering,  municipal or urban engineering, water resources engineering,  quantity surveying, coastal engineering  and construction engineering. Civil engineers design, construct, supervise, operate, and maintain large construction projects and systems, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment.
                <br>
                br>The U G programme in Civil Engineering of ASIET was established in 2013 with an intake of 60 students. The current strength of the Department is 246 students and 17 faculties.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Department is providing ancillary facilities to students in areas of civil engineering drawing, structural designing and project management. Currently 3 batches of students have passed out from the department .
              </p>

              <h2>Vision</h2>
              <p>“To impart knowledge and excellence in Civil Engineering with global perspectives.”</p>
